Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on medical attributes. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset that includes features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this model aims to provide a reliable prediction to assist in early detection of diabetes, which could potentially help in taking preventive measures.
