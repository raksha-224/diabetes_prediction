Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on medical attributes. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset that includes features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this model aims to provide a reliable prediction to assist in early detection of diabetes, which could potentially help in taking preventive measures.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their medical history and biometric data.
